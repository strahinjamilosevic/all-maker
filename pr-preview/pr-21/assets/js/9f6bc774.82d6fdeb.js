A long time ago I studied English language and literature. I don\'t know if I see myself as a linguist, but studying language and literature has definitely shaped how I view the world.\\n\\nThere\'s a plethora of things that interest me. I think what defines me is that I just get up and try them out. \\"Jack of all trades, master of none...\\" kind of deal, yes.\\n\\nWhat do I see myself as? I don\'t know. I\'d probably say a dedicated father and husband. An avid music enjoyer, a disentangler of topics, and a vain old fart. ;)\\n\\nBut that\'s the point of the old saying: \\"...oftentimes better than a master of one.\\" In any case, definitely \u2014 a maker of sorts.\\n","imageURL":"/pr-preview/pr-21/img/prof.jpg","key":"strahinja","count":10}]}')}}]);
