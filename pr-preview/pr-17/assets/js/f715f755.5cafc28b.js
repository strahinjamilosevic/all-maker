You could be looking at pure technical competencies but the position is a leadership one. In which case, you are more akin to an engineering manager than what is usually referred to as an individual contributor.\\n\\nIn both of those cases, it\'s good to have a handy resource with general, or even very specific, guidelines as to what different levels of an individually-contributing technical writer mean. Whether you manage people or are looking to take charge of your own career, the levels below cover most of the technical writing career ladder. \\n\\n## Individual contributor path\\n\\n### Junior technical writer\\n\\n| Category | Description |\\n|:---|:---|\\n| **Craft** | Learns and applies the documentation team\'s tools and templates.

But the role has changed. It now sits at the center of design thinking, context protocols, content strategy, user journeys, AI-augmented authoring, automated workflows, docs as a product, and communication between humans and machines.\\n\\nIf you still treat technical writing as a support function, you will miss where product value now lives.\\n\\nLanguage is no longer a layer on top of software. It shapes how software behaves. In AI-native systems, language is part of the system.\\n\\nYou do not need a better writer. You need someone who designs how knowledge flows across your organization and your product.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Start with the system, not the document\\n\\nYou do not scale documentation by writing more pages. You scale it by designing the system that produces, structures, and distributes knowledge.\\n\\nModern products are complex. They include APIs, integrations, agents, workflows, and AI features. Users do not interact with a single screen. They move across surfaces, contexts, and states. Machines also consume your content. LLMs read it. Agents act on it.\\n\\nIf you do not design your knowledge architecture, it will fragment.\\n\\n**The modern technical writer must design the system behind the content, not just the content itself.**\\nYou shift from writing documents to designing knowledge infrastructure.\\n\\n## Apply design thinking to knowledge\\n\\nYou already apply design thinking to product features. You must apply the same rigor to knowledge.\\n\\nStart with user problems. Map moments of confusion. Identify where users drop off. Treat documentation as part of the user journey, not as an afterthought.\\n\\nWhen you design knowledge around real tasks, you reduce support tickets, shorten onboarding time, and improve activation.\\n\\nYou stop asking, \\"What should we document?\\" and start asking, \\"Where does the user lose clarity?\\"\\nYou design knowledge around user friction, not around product releases.\\n\\n## Define context protocols for humans and machines\\n\\nAI systems depend on context. If your knowledge lacks structure, your AI will drift.\\n\\nYou must define canonical terms, consistent definitions, structured formats, and reusable components. You must ensure that product logic translates clearly into machine-readable form.\\n\\nWhen you do this work well, you reduce hallucination risk, improve output consistency, and protect user trust.\\n\\n**Context does not emerge by accident. You must design it.**\\nYou own the rules that shape how humans and machines interpret your product.\\n\\n## Build a content strategy that scales\\n\\nContent strategy no longer means planning blog posts or release notes. It means deciding how information becomes reusable, structured, and maintainable.\\n\\nYou must decide:\\n\\n- What becomes structured data.\\n- What becomes reusable components.\\n- What becomes API-readable.\\n- What should not exist at all.\\n\\nWhen you treat content as a system, you reduce redundancy and increase speed. Engineers, support teams, and AI systems can rely on the same source of truth.\\n\\n**Scale does not come from writing faster. It comes from structuring better.**\\nYou design content to behave like infrastructure, not like static text.\\n\\n## Design user journeys across surfaces\\n\\nUsers do not distinguish between UI, docs, and support. They experience a single journey.\\n\\nYou must map how users move from product interface to documentation, from documentation to AI assistance, and from AI to support. You must design recovery paths when something fails.\\n\\nClear transitions increase confidence. Confidence drives adoption.\\n\\n**Documentation is part of your product experience, whether you admit it or not.**\\nYou design continuity across every moment where understanding can break.\\n\\n## Build AI-augmented authoring flows\\n\\nYou cannot scale knowledge with manual effort alone. You must design how AI supports content creation.\\n\\nCreate structured templates. Build prompt libraries. Automate review processes. Use AI for consistency checks, terminology validation, and structural alignment.\\n\\nWhen you design authoring flows intentionally, you improve speed and quality at the same time.\\n\\n**AI should not replace writers. It should extend them.**\\nYou design the system that makes humans and AI collaborate effectively.\\n\\n## Automate content workflows\\n\\nIf your documentation process relies on manual updates, you will fall behind.\\n\\nYou must integrate version control, structured content models, and automated publishing pipelines. Connect documentation to product changes. Treat knowledge like code, with review processes, traceability, and iteration.\\n\\nAutomation reduces errors and prevents knowledge decay.\\n\\n**Operational discipline applies to content just as much as it applies to engineering.**\\nYou apply DevOps thinking to knowledge management.\\n\\n## Treat docs as a product\\n\\nDocumentation influences onboarding, activation, retention, and developer experience. You must treat it like a product.\\n\\nDefine metrics. Analyze usage patterns. Test changes. Prioritize improvements. Maintain a roadmap.\\n\\nWhen you invest in documentation strategically, you reduce support costs and increase user success.\\n\\n**Docs do not support the product. Docs are part of the product.**\\nYou manage documentation with the same rigor as any customer-facing feature.\\n\\n## Navigate communication between humans and machines\\n\\nIn AI-enabled systems, language becomes executable. Prompts shape behavior. Output shapes trust.\\n\\nYou must translate product logic into instructions machines can interpret. You must translate machine output into explanations humans can understand. You must design transparency, disclaimers, and recovery paths.\\n\\nIf you ignore this layer, risk increases. Confusion spreads. Trust erodes.\\n\\n**Someone must own the interface between human intention and machine behavior.**\\nYou design how intelligence expresses itself through language.\\n\\n## Redefine the role\\n\\nThe traditional title \\"technical writer\\" no longer captures the scope of this work.\\n\\nYou now design knowledge systems, context architecture, AI interaction patterns, workflow automation, and cross-surface user journeys. You influence product clarity, AI reliability, operational efficiency, and user trust.\\n\\nLanguage shapes how your system thinks.

Or I\'ll set up two agents \u2014 one playing the role of a skeptical developer, the other a first-time user \u2014 and have them both review the same doc. You\'d be surprised what falls out.\\n\\nThis isn\'t about replacing human review. It\'s about showing up to the human review with fewer obvious issues.\\n\\n### The pipeline nobody built\\n\\nHere\'s a real example. I inherited a codebase where the developers never wrote explicit API documentation. No OpenAPI spec. Nothing. The endpoints existed in the code, scattered across files, undocumented.\\n\\nSo I set up multiple LLM agents \u2014 different models, different instructions \u2014 and had them analyze the code, generate OpenAPI specs, and then argue with each other about whether the specs were accurate. One agent generates. Another validates. A third tries to break it.\\n\\nThe result isn\'t perfect. But it\'s a starting point that would have taken weeks to produce manually. And now there\'s a single source of truth where there was none.\\n\\n### Instruction files and prompt libraries\\n\\nKeep markdown files with instructions per use case. I have different ones for different tasks \u2014 reviewing for plain language, checking structural consistency, generating code samples, and so on. When you reuse the same prompt across projects, it becomes a tool in itself. Sharpen it over time.\\n\\n## Modes of working with AI\\n\\nNot all AI-augmented work looks the same. The way I see it, there are a few distinct modes, and knowing when to use which one matters more than which model you pick.\\n\\n### Chat \u2014 the rubber duck\\n\\nOpen a browser tab. Talk to it like a colleague. Ask it to explain a codebase you just inherited. Bounce an outline off it. Get a second opinion on your content architecture before you spend two days building it.\\n\\nBest for: exploration, understanding, brainstorming.\\n\\nTools: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini \u2014 browser-based, conversational.\\n\\n### Inline assist \u2014 the co-pilot\\n\\nThis is your IDE whispering suggestions as you type. Tab completion, reformatting, fixing broken links, repetitive edits across 40 files. It\'s not creative work \u2014 it\'s grunt work you shouldn\'t be doing manually.\\n\\nBest for: repetitive tasks, pattern-based edits, formatting.\\n\\nTools: GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Cody, any IDE-integrated assistant.\\n\\n### Drafting \u2014 the ghostwriter\\n\\nYou provide the context, the constraints, the style guide. The AI generates a first draft. You refine. This works surprisingly well for things like release notes, API reference descriptions, and structured content where the format is predictable.\\n\\nBest for: first drafts, boilerplate, structured content.\\n\\nOne rule: if the output is good, use it. Don\'t feel obligated to rewrite a perfectly fine doc just because AI wrote it.\\n\\n### Automation \u2014 the assembly line\\n\\nThis is where it gets interesting. CI/CD integration. Style linting. Automated spec generation. Agents that run in the background and flag issues before you even open the file. This mode requires setup, but once it\'s running, it scales in a way that manual work never will.\\n\\nBest for: validation, spec generation, continuous quality checks.\\n\\nTools: Claude Code, OpenHands, custom scripts, MCP servers, whatever gets the job done.\\n\\n## Pick the model, not the brand\\n\\nDifferent models are better at different things. As of right now, here\'s how I think about it:\\n\\n- **Claude** \u2014 strong at long-form writing, structured content, and following detailed instructions. My go-to for doc work.\\n- **GPT** \u2014 solid generalist. Good at code generation and quick answers. The ecosystem is massive.\\n- **Gemini** \u2014 great context window. Useful when you need to feed it an entire codebase or a 200-page spec and ask questions.\\n\\nThis changes every few months. Don\'t marry a model. Date all of them.\\n\\n## The actual point\\n\\nNone of this matters if you don\'t have the fundamentals. AI won\'t save you if you don\'t understand your users, can\'t structure content, or don\'t know what simplified technical English is.\\n\\nThe tools amplify what you already have. If what you have is solid craft \u2014 structured authoring, user-centered thinking, domain knowledge, a willingness to figure it out \u2014 then AI makes you faster, broader, and harder to replace.\\n\\nIf what you have is vibes and a ChatGPT subscription, well. The cheap tool is going to break real fast.\\n\\nUse whatever is at your disposal to get the product out. Then get better. Then get faster. Then help someone else do the same.\\n\\nThat\'s the job."},{"id":"cheap-tools","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-17/blog/cheap-tools","editUrl":"https://github.com/strahinjamilosevic/all-maker/tree/master/blog/2026-02-10-cheap-tools.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-10-cheap-tools.md","title":"Use cheap tools until they break","description":"Adam Savage once said that as a hobbyist, you should buy the cheapest tools you can find and use them until they break.

Paligo. FrameMaker. Zendesk. Confluence. A CCMS that lets you publish topics and structure content? Great. IntelliJ\'s visual Git interface so you don\'t have to memorize CLI commands on day one? Totally fine. I love that thing.\\n\\nThe point is: don\'t let tooling anxiety stop you from shipping.\\n\\nThe skills matter more than the stack. Structured authoring, simplified technical English, user experience, content architecture \u2014 these don\'t change because you switched from Confluence to a static site generator. The fundamentals are the fundamentals. Focus on the process, the knowledge, and the writing.\\n\\nLearn how to interview a developer. Learn how to break down a feature into tasks a reader can actually follow. Learn how to say the same thing in half the words. None of that requires a terminal.\\n\\n## When the cheap tool breaks\\n\\nYou\'ll know when it happens.\\n\\nThe GUI can\'t handle your reuse model. The CMS chokes on your branching strategy. You need automation that doesn\'t exist yet. You\'re copy-pasting the same update across 40 files and thinking there has to be a better way.\\n\\nThere is. And you\'re ready for it \u2014 because you\'ve hit the wall.\\n\\nThat\'s when you go all in. CLI. Scripting. Pipelines. You start single-sourcing your OpenAPI specs straight from the source code. You automate generation of the sneak preview and the release notes. You add linters and style guides that run in CI. You set up an AI assistant that catches issues before you even open the file.\\n\\nAnd here\'s the thing. By this point? You\'re not guessing. You\'re not automating for the sake of automating. You know exactly which part of the workflow is broken because you lived in it. You used the cheap tools. You developed the essential skills. Now you\'re investing your time where it actually matters.\\n\\n## \\"Afford\\" doesn\'t mean money\\n\\nIn this context, \\"the best tools you can afford\\" means time.\\n\\nIf you can invest in Python and version control from day one, do it. But if you\'re unsure about the career, hard-pressed for time, or just overwhelmed \u2014 resolve your merge conflicts visually and move on. No shame.\\n\\nThe tools don\'t make the writer. The writer makes the tools worth using.\\n\\n## See also\\n\\n- [Arguing with a robot](/blog/argue-with-robot)"},{"id":"tech-bro","metadata":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-17/blog/tech-bro","editUrl":"https://github.com/strahinjamilosevic/all-maker/tree/master/blog/2026-02-01-tech-bro.md","source":"@site/blog/2026-02-01-tech-bro.md","title":"Tech bro VS caveman","description":"Something weird is happening in tech.","date":"2026-02-01T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Opinion","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-17/blog/tags/opinion"},{"inline":false,"label":"Lifestyle","permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-17/blog/tags/lifestyle"}],"readingTime":2.09,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Strahinja Milo\u0161evi\u0107","title":"Senior Technical Writer","url":"https://strahinjamilosevic.github.io/","page":{"permalink":"/pr-preview/pr-17/blog/authors/strahinja"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/strahinjamilosevic/","github":"https://github.com/strahinjamilosevic"},"description":"Hi, I\'m Stra.
