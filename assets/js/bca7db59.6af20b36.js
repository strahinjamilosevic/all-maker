A long time ago I studied English language and literature. I don\'t know if I see myself as a linguist, but studying language and literature has definitely shaped how I view the world.\\n\\nThere\'s a plethora of things that interest me. I think what defines me is that I just get up and try them out. \\"Jack of all trades, master of none...\\" kind of deal, yes.\\n\\nWhat do I see myself as? I don\'t know. I\'d probably say a dedicated father and husband. An avid music enjoyer, a disentangler of topics, and a vain old fart. ;)\\n\\nBut that\'s the point of the old saying: \\"...oftentimes better than a master of one.\\" In any case, definitely \u2014 a maker of sorts.\\n","imageURL":"/img/prof.jpg","key":"strahinja"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"tech-art","title":"Tech and art","authors":["strahinja"],"tags":["opinion","lifestyle"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Alien tech writer","permalink":"/blog/alien"},"nextItem":{"title":"Arguing with a robot","permalink":"/blog/argue-with-robot"}}')},4033(e,t,n){n.r(t),n.d(t,{assets:()=>l,contentTitle:()=>r,default:()=>d,frontMatter:()=>o,metadata:()=>i,toc:()=>h});var i=n(332),a=n(4848),s=n(8453);const o={slug:"tech-art",title:"Tech and art",authors:["strahinja"],tags:["opinion","lifestyle"]},r=void 0,l={authorsImageUrls:[void 0]},h=[];function u(e){const t={em:"em",p:"p",...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return(0,a.jsxs)(a.Fragment,{children:[(0,a.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Tech keeps you capable.
