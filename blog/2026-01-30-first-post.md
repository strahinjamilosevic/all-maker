*Sometimes, you just need to write it down.*

Hello everybody! Welcome, welcome.

At the time of posting this, my plan for this blog is not to write instructional content as I would at a corporation. Rather, I want to offer my experience about what I've done so far and how I found it easier to do. But maybe most of all, I want to reinforce my discipline, planning, and day-to-day. 

One of the reasons behind this is from 2019 when I learned how to create a website for a portfolio from a YouTube video. I managed to put my CV online in 2 hours wothout any prior coding knowledge. It's still [online](https://strahinjamilosevic.github.io/). Shoutout to [html5up.net](https://html5up.net/) for free themes, [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/) for free HD images, and [Joshua Fluke](https://www.youtube.com/@JoshuaFluke1) for the instructional video.

It wasn't optimal for authoring experience, pipeline, SEO, and especially the content. But it was fast, free, looked okay and got the job done.

So, I want to try and tailor the content to show how I do things in a way optimized for *me*. Maybe you find it helpful. Maybe it sparks something within you and inspires you to do it better.

You know what they say: If you want something done quickly, post an incorrect instruction. People will flock to correct you.
