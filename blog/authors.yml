    Hi, I'm Stra. A long time ago I studied English language and literature. I don't know if I see myself as a linguist, but studying language and literature has definitely shaped how I view the world.

    There's a plethora of things that interest me. I think what defines me is that I just get up and try them out. "Jack of all trades, master of none..." kind of deal, yes.

    What do I see myself as? I don't know. I'd probably say a dedicated father and husband. An avid music enjoyer, a disentangler of topics, and a vain old fart. ;)

    But that's the point of the old saying: "...oftentimes better than a master of one." In any case, definitely — a maker of sorts.
