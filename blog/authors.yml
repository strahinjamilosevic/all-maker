    Hi, I'm Stra. A long time ago I studied English language and literature. I don't know if I see myself as a linguist, but studying language and literature has definitely shaped how I view the world.

    There's a plethora of things that interest me and I'd say that one of the things that define me is — I just get and try them out. "Jack of all trades, master of none..." kind of deal.

    What do I see myself as? I don't know. I'd probably prefer to say a dedicated father and husband. An avid music enjoyer, a disentangler of topics, and a vain old fart. ;)

    But that's the deal: "....oftentimes better than a master of one." But, definitely — a maker of sorts.
