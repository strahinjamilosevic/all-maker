As anybody who has done it even a little bit will tell you: technical writing is mostly - not writing.

While every company has its own definitions of skills, responsibilities, and expectations it is important to understand that there are also different dimensions of these definitions. You could be looking at pure technical competencies but the position is a leadership one. In which case, you are more akin to an engineering manager than what is usually referred to as an individual contributor.

In both of those cases, it's good to have a handy resource with general, or even very specific, guidelines as to what different levels of an individually-contributing technical writer mean. Whether you manage people or are looking to take charge of your own career, the levels below cover most of the technical writing career ladder. 

## Individual contributor path

### Junior technical writer

|:---|:---|
| **Craft** | Learns and applies the documentation team's tools and templates. Delivers defined documentation tasks under close guidance. Writes clear content with support. Participates in doc reviews and applies feedback. Begins developing awareness of documentation quality, structure, and user needs. |
| **Collaboration** | Asks clarifying questions. Keeps the team updated on progress. Participates in team discussions. Open to feedback. Works with engineers, PMs, and peers to gather content inputs. |
| **Business Impact** | Learns how documentation contributes to product value. Understands basic customer needs. Shares relevant user and stakeholder feedback with peers. |

### (Mid-Level) Technical writer

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Craft** | Independently owns end-to-end documentation tasks of moderate complexity. Applies templates and docs strategy consistently. Writes and organizes high-quality content with limited oversight. Reviews peer content. Suggests improvements to tooling and templates. |
| **Collaboration** | Communicates clearly across teams. Proactively aligns with engineering and product to understand upcoming changes. Offers and receives feedback constructively. Helps keep team documentation and ClickUp tasks up to date. |
| **Business Impact** | Understands product use cases and how docs improve usability. Begins suggesting prioritization of doc work based on business value. Shares user feedback proactively and proposes improvements beyond documentation (e.g., UI labels, workflows). |

### Senior technical writer

### Staff technical writer

| Category | Description |
|:---|:---|
| **Craft** | Drives technical documentation direction across multiple teams or domains. Leads complex doc migrations, tooling changes, and strategic initiatives (e.g., AI integration, docs-as-code, source annotation, doc portals). Sets documentation standards and mentors across teams. Shapes content culture. |
| **Collaboration** | Builds coalitions across departments (Engineering, Legal, Support, Product, Marketing). Acts as subject-matter expert in documentation strategy. Resolves org-wide information flow problems. Coaches technical writers and cross-functional teams. |
| **Business Impact** | Aligns documentation work with company strategy. Influences roadmap through user feedback and content strategy. Measures and communicates documentation ROI. Leads hiring or helps define career ladders and onboarding for tech writers. Shapes company-wide tooling and knowledge strategy. |

## Mapping to your organization's engineering levels

In most engineering orgs, these are equivalent to:

| Engineering level | Tech writer equivalent | Scope |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Junior engineer | Junior technical writer | Executes scoped tasks with support |
| Medior engineer | Technical writer | Owns mid-sized documentation tasks end-to-end |
| Senior engineer | Senior technical writer | Leads projects and helps define strategy |
| Staff engineer | Staff technical writer | Cross-team technical leadership and strategy |
| Principal engineer | (Optional) Principal technical writer | Rare, focused on company-wide initiatives, tools, and vision |

Most orgs have these, but keep them internal. As an open-source platform with a strong documentation culture, GitLab has a lot of useful resources. So feel free to take inspiration, as I did:
