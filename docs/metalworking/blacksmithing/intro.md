 This February 2026 I embarked on a new adventure. blacksmithing workshop at [Openbarewerkplaats](https://openbarewerkplaats.nl/shop/metaal/smeden/smeden/) in Amsterdam.

 Our goal is to learn basic blacksmithing techniques using manual tools and a coal forge. The end product after four three-hour sessions - a knife of our design that we get to take home!

Here, I plan to take you on this journey with me, demo the process, and showcase the learnings from each session:

1. [Learn the basics](docs\metalworking\blacksmithing\first-session.md)
2. [Forge the blade](docs\metalworking\blacksmithing\second-session.md)
