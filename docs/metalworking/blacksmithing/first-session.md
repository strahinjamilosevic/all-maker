The first evening, our task was to familiarize ourselves with the tools, the process, and do a small project - forge a coat hanger from an iron bar.

This meant we had to learn how to:

- Work the coal and gas forges
- Select the proper tool
- Round off a square iron bar
- Make a point and curl it
- Twist the bar
- Flatten it into a leaf shape
- Decorate the leaf and curl the branch
- Drill the mounting holes
