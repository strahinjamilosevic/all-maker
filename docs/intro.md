In this section, you can browse the projects I embarked on during the years. I mostly tried to keep the mind and the fingers busy to deal with the inescapable, soul-crushing realities of life.

I like to think it saved me along the way. Awarded me experiences that make me a bit less insufferable to listen to at the end of the bar. :)

I hope you enjoy some part of the journey. There is much more than I can remember at the moment, so I am starting with the latest:

- [Metalworking](/docs/metalworking/intro.md)
- [Leatherworking](/docs/leatherworking/intro.md)
- [Cooking](/docs/cooking/flatbreads.md)
