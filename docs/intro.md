# Intro
 
In this section, you can browse the projects I embarked on during the years. I mostly tried to keep the mind and the fingers busy to deal with the inescapable, soul-crushing realities of life.

I like to think it saved me along the way, and awarded me experiences that make me a bit less insufferable to listen to from the end of the bar. :)

I hope you enjoy some part of the journey. There is much more that I can remember at the moment, so I am starting with the latest:
